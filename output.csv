New Mexico;2017,"New Mexico is one of eight states that fund college scholarships through the state lottery.[169][170][171] The state of New Mexico requires that the lottery put 30% of its gross sales into the scholarship fund.[172]
The scholarship is available to residents who graduated from a state high school, and attend a state university full-time while maintaining a 2.5 GPA or higher.[173]
It covered 100% of tuition when it was first instated in 1996,[174] decreased to 90%, then dropped to 60% in 2017.[170] The value slightly increased in 2018, and new legislation was passed to outline what funds are available per type of institution.[174]
